# Aaron Davila's Portfolio

Username: @AaronDavila05

I am a computer scientist at CSUF and expect to graduate in 2028

Here's my portfolio

* Lab 12

  The reason why I liked Lab 12 was because the lab felt different that the others. In this lab we were able to work with images and gifs for the first time ever. The lab combined almost everything that we learned in all CPSC 120A/L. Using things like constant functions, for loops, and if loops created a perfect end to a great semester. Lastly, by completing this lab, it further strengthens my passion to pursue computer science.

* Lab 7

  The reason why I liked Lab 7 and gave it my number 2 spot in my favorite labs is it was one of the first times that we were able to use Boolean operators effectively in a sense that seem logical to the human eye. The ability to code when to park on certain days using the Boolean operators really made labs fun. I liked how we used real streets in our code with pictures. The entire point of the lab was to work with Boolean operators and get an understanding when you are allowed to park in the designated area at a given time.

* Lab 6

  The Reason why Lab 6 was my third favorite lab is because it taught me how to make one of my favorite table games. Using Boolean operators to assign unique cards and playing the game made me feel proud about my work. It tells me if I won or lost by pulling some random cards. The whole point of the lab was to work with If else statements and Boolean expressions.

Lastly, I enjoyed meeting a whole ton of different people in my labs. Some of these people were people who I probably would have never met and they were great to work with
